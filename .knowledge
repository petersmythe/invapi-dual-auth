### Investec Card IDE bugs

* Toggle Simulator back on doesn't work
* In env.json, number or boolean gets forced to a string

### GitHub pages markdown

How frustrating is it that admonitions (e.g. > :bulb: :warning: ) work in https://github.com/petersmythe/invapi-dual-auth but not in https://petersmythe.github.io/invapi-dual-auth/ - they appear to use different flavours of markdown

### Visa 2 second timeout

Watch out for that 2 second limit for the `beforeTransaction` function!  If you do not `return false` well before 2 seconds, the transaction is automatically approved.  The simulator does not enforce this same limit, unfortunately.
